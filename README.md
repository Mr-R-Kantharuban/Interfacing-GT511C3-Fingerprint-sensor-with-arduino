Interfacing GT511C3 Fingerprint sensor with arduino. Enrollement and accessing
Pls go throught the example folder::

Four Example Sketches

FPS_Blink: Execution of this program will blink the blue LEDs in the sensing region.

FPS_Enroll: Execution of this program let us enroll the fingerprint

FPS_IDFinger: Execution of this program lets us identify the scanned fingerprint.

FPS_Serial_Passthrough: As I have told you earlier, we can use SK_DEMO.exe software with Arduino IDE. 
This program can be uploaded to the Arduino to access the SK_DEMO.exe to upload/delete any fingerprint image on the PC.
